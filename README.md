## Week:1 TODO

- Get the data(public) and start writing the replication code.
- Check and access the student repo.

**Notes**

1. Original code to download data is not working. write a script n get data
2. Figure out what numerical measurements they used n get them. (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, GHI, DNI, diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), and atmospheric pressure.)
